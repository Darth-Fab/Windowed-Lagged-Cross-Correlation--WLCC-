# Windowed-Lagged Cross-Correlation for Dyadic Studies
This repository hosts an R script for conducting Windowed-Lagged Cross-Correlation analysis in dyadic studies exploring trust and prosocial behavior. The script enables the assessment of synchrony strength between heart rate (HR) and skin conductance (SC) signals at different time lags. Future updates will include support for analyzing facial expressions.
